# DerivativeTransformer

C program that reads a mathematical expression of one variable from the user input until EOF then returns the derivative representation (not evaluated). 
The program implements and uses Dijkstra's Shunting Algorithm for converting infix expressions to postfix and evaluation.

### The user input expression may contain:
- Natural numbers
- Variable X
- sin
- tan
- sh
- ch
- ln
- Operators
  - \+
  - \-
  - \/
  - \*
  - \^
